# MizzouMenuSolver
this is made by Tyler Brotherton
This program scraps the Mizzou dining hall sites and displays the menu and times that the dining halls are open. If you go to Mizzou, and want to know what the dining halls are serving, this is the program for you. 

this repo is in C++. Don't like C++, sucks to suck. I'm going to try and use as much C convention as I can. 
However, this is only possible due to the object orientented abilities of the greatest programming langunge ever.
Additionally, C++ is the top 10 most popular programming langunges, but no professor teaches C++.
I have a pet theory that no professor knows c++. They go directly from c->c#?

Yo, if Mizzou admin/professors is reading this, give me my research funding, plz?
